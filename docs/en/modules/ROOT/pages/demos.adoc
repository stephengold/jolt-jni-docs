_Demo apps_ are provided to showcase certain features of {Project}.
The following apps are found in
{url-examples}[the com.github.stephengold.sportjolt.javaapp.demo package of the {Sport} "java-apps" sub-project]:

* {url-examples}/NewtonsCradle.java[`NewtonsCradle`]
  demonstrates dynamic restitution and distance constraints
* {url-examples}/Pachinko.java[`Pachinko`]
  demonstrates compound shapes and 2-D physics
* {url-examples}/ThousandCubes.java[`ThousandCubes`]
  demonstrates stacking cubes and launching projectiles


== User interface

The demo apps are controlled primarily by keyboard input.

NOTE: The descriptions below assume a keyboard with the "US" (QWERTY) layout.
On keyboards with other layouts, the keys may be labeled differently.

For convenience, the mapping of keys to actions is partly standardized.
In all demo apps:

* kbd:[.] and kbd:[Pause] toggle the simulation between running and paused,
* kbd:[C] dumps the camera's position to the console, and
* kbd:[Esc] ends the app.

For camera control, all demo apps use `DragLMB` rotation mode.
This means you can rotate the camera by dragging with the left mouse button.
Furthermore:

* kbd:[W] and kbd:[S] dolly the camera forward and back, respectively,
* kbd:[A] and kbd:[D] dolly the camera left and right, respectively,
* kbd:[Q] raises the camera, and
* kbd:[Z] lowers the camera.

Additional mappings are specific to each app:

* In `NewtonsCradle`:

** kbd:[F1], kbd:[1], and kbd:[Numpad1] restart with a single ball
** kbd:[F2], kbd:[2], and kbd:[Numpad2] restart with 2 balls
** kbd:[F3], kbd:[3], and kbd:[Numpad3] restart with 3 balls
** kbd:[F4], kbd:[4], and kbd:[Numpad4] restart with 4 balls
** kbd:[F5], kbd:[5], and kbd:[Numpad5] restart with 5 balls

* In `Pachinko`:

** kbd:[F4], kbd:[4], and kbd:[Numpad4] restart with 4 rows of pins
** kbd:[F5], kbd:[5], and kbd:[Numpad5] restart with 5 rows of pins
** kbd:[F6], kbd:[6], and kbd:[Numpad6] restart with 6 rows of pins
** kbd:[F7], kbd:[7], and kbd:[Numpad7] restart with 7 rows of pins
** kbd:[F8], kbd:[8], and kbd:[Numpad8] restart with 8 rows of pins
** kbd:[F9], kbd:[9], and kbd:[Numpad9] restart with 9 rows of pins

* In `ThousandCubes`:

** kbd:[E] launch a red ball
