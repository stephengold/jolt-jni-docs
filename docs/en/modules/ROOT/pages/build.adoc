= How to build Jolt JNI from source
:Project: Jolt JNI
:ProjectAdj: Jolt-JNI

{Project} is free, open-source software.

While pre-built library artifacts (including AARs and JARs)
can be downloaded from the Maven Central Repository,
some people prefer to build them from source.

You can also build a local copy of the documentation website (including HTML).
This is useful if you are editing the documentation,
or if your Internet access is limited or unreliable.

== Library artifacts

Here's the recommended procedure:

. Install build software:
.. a https://adoptium.net/releases.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)],
  if you don't already have one, and
.. one of the supported C++ compilers:
... for Linux:  https://gcc.gnu.org/[the GNU Compiler Collection] or https://www.llvm.org[Clang]
... for macOS:  https://developer.apple.com/xcode[Xcode]
... for Windows:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com[Microsoft Visual Studio]
.. If you use GCC, you might need to install the "g++-multilib" package:
... `sudo apt install g++-multilib`
. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
   That path might look something like
   "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.3.7-hotspot"
   or "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/" or
   "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home" .
.. using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
.. using https://fishshell.com/[Fish]: `set -g JAVA_HOME "` *path to installation* `"`
.. using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
. Download and extract the {ProjectAdj} source code from GitHub:
.. using https://git-scm.com[Git]:
... `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni.git`
... `cd jolt-jni`
... `git checkout -b latest 0.9.8`
.. using a web browser:
... browse to https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni/releases/latest
... follow the "Source code (zip)" link at the bottom of the page
... save the ZIP file
... extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
... `cd` to the extracted directory
. (optional) Edit the "gradle.properties" file to configure the build.
. Run the https://gradle.org[Gradle] wrapper to build desktop artifacts:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`
. To build Android artifacts, you'll need to
  install https://developer.android.com/studio[Android Studio]
  and point the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to that installation.
. Run the Gradle wrapper to build Android artifacts:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew -b android.gradle build`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew -b android.gradle build`

After a successful build,
library artifacts will be found in "build/libs" (desktop)
and "build/outputs/aar" (Android).

=== Local installation

You can install the artifacts to your local Maven repository:

. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install;./gradlew -b android.gradle install`
. using Windows Command Prompt:
.. `.\gradlew install`
.. `.\gradlew -b android.gradle install`

=== Cleanup

After a build, you can restore the project to a pristine state:

* using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew clean;./gradlew -b android.gradle clean`
* using Windows Command Prompt:
** `.\gradlew clean`
** `.\gradlew -b android.gradle clean`

== Documentation website

. https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/#install-nodejs[Install Node.js]
. Download and extract the jolt-jni-docs source code from GitHub:
.. using Git:
... `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni-docs.git`
... `cd jolt-jni`
.. using a web browser:
... browse to https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni-docs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
... extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file
... `cd` to the extracted directory
. Edit "docs/playbook.yml" and replace "/home/sgold/NetBeansProjects/LbjExamples"
  with an absolute path to your extracted directory (2 places).
. Run Antora:
.. `npx antora docs/playbook.yml`

After a successful build,
your local copy of the site will be found in the "docs/build/site" directory.
