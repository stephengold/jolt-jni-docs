= How to build Jolt JNI from source
:Cplusplus: C&#43;&#43;
:Project: Jolt JNI
:ProjectAdj: Jolt-JNI

{Project} is free, open-source software.

While pre-built library artifacts (including AARs and JARs)
can be downloaded from the Maven Central Repository,
some people prefer to build them from source.

You can also build a local copy of the documentation website (including HTML).
This is useful if you are editing the documentation,
or if your Internet access is limited or unreliable.

The official demo applications are maintained in a separate GitHub repo.
Instructions for running them are on xref:demos.adoc[the Demo apps page].


== Libraries

=== For desktop platforms

Here's the recommended procedure for building desktop libraries:

. Install build software:
.. a https://adoptium.net/releases.html[Java Development Kit (JDK)],
  version 21 or higher, and
.. one of the supported {Cplusplus} compilers:
... for Linux:  https://gcc.gnu.org/[the GNU Compiler Collection] or https://www.llvm.org[Clang]
... for macOS:  https://developer.apple.com/xcode[Xcode]
... for Windows:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com[Microsoft Visual Studio]
.. If you use GCC, you might also need to install the "g++-multilib" package:
... `sudo apt install g++-multilib`
. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
   (The path might look similar to
   "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.3.7-hotspot"
   or "/usr/lib/jvm/java-21-openjdk-amd64/" or
   "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-21.jdk/Contents/Home".)
.. using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
.. using https://fishshell.com/[Fish]: `set -g JAVA_HOME "` *path to installation* `"`
.. using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
. Download and extract the {ProjectAdj} source code from GitHub:
.. using https://git-scm.com[Git]:
... `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni.git`
... `cd jolt-jni`
... `git checkout -b latest 3.6.0`
.. using a web browser:
... browse to https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni/releases/latest
... follow the "Source code (zip)" link
... save the ZIP file
... extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
... `cd` to the extracted directory
. Edit the "gradle.properties" file to configure the build.
. Run the https://gradle.org[Gradle] wrapper on the desktop build script:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
desktop library artifacts will be found in "build/libs".

==== Ported examples

Once you've built a desktop library for your current platform,
you can test it by running example apps that have been ported from {Cplusplus}.

The "hello world" example app:

* using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runHelloWorld`
* using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runHelloWorld`

Various scenes in the "performance test" example app:

. the ConvexVsMesh scene:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runConvexVsMesh`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runConvexVsMesh`
. the Pyramid scene:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runPyramid`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runPyramid`
. the Ragdoll scene:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew runRagdoll`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew runRagdoll`

=== For Androids

Once you've successfully built one or more desktop libraries,
you can build Android libraries.

. You'll need to install https://developer.android.com/studio[Android Studio]
  and point the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to that installation.
. Edit the "gradle.properties" file to configure the build.
. Run the Gradle wrapper:
.. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew -b android.gradle assemble`
.. using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew -b android.gradle assemble`

After a successful build,
Android library artifacts will be found "build/outputs/aar".

=== Local installation

Once you've successfully built one or more libraries,
you can install them to your local Maven repository.

. using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install;./gradlew -b android.gradle install`
. using Windows Command Prompt:
.. `.\gradlew install`
.. `.\gradlew -b android.gradle install`


== Website

. Download and extract the jolt-jni-docs source code from GitHub:
.. using Git:
... `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni-docs.git`
... `cd jolt-jni-docs`
.. using a web browser:
... browse to https://github.com/stephengold/jolt-jni-docs/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
... extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file
... `cd` to the extracted directory
. Edit "docs/playbook.yml" and replace "/home/sgold/NetBeansProjects/jolt-jni-docs"
  with an absolute path to your extracted directory (2 places).
. https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/install-and-run-quickstart/#install-nodejs[Install Node.js]
. Install Antora: `npm i -D -E @antora/cli@3.1`
. Run Antora: `npx antora docs/playbook.yml`

After a successful build,
your local site copy will be found in the "docs/build/site" directory.


== Cleanup

At any time, you can restore the project to a pristine state:

* using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew clean;./gradlew -b android.gradle clean`
* using Windows Command Prompt:
** `.\gradlew clean`
** `.\gradlew -b android.gradle clean`
