A _constraint_ is a physics object
that restricts the motion of one or more rigid bodies.

The motion of a rigid body is decomposed into 6 _degrees of freedom (DOFs)_:
3 axes of _translation_ (purely linear motion) and 3 axes of rotation.
(Confusingly, Jolt Physics refers to all 6 DOFs as "axes".)

Constraints can limit specific DOFs of a body to specific ranges,
or even _fix_ (freeze) those DOFs completely.
Constraints can also simulate linkages *between* bodies,
such that the motion of one body affects the motion of another.


== Conceptual examples

For instance, a door might swing on hinges.
In simulation, those hinges could be represented by a _hinge constraint_
applied to the door body.
The constraint would fix 5 of the door's DOFs,
preventing it from translating away from its hinges
or rotating around any axis except that of its hinges.
Thus constrained, the door's only possible motion
would be rotation around the axis of its hinges.

Or a door might slide along a linear track.
In that case, the track could be represented by a _slider constraint_
applied to the door body.
The constraint would fix 5 of the door's DOFs,
preventing it from rotating in any way
or translating along any axis except that of its track.
Thus constrained, the door's only possible motion
would be to translate along its track.

Or imagine a pen holder mounted on a ball and socket:
it can freely turn and twist to any orientation,
but the ball end canâ€™t leave the socket.
To simulate this, you'd want a constraint that fixes
translation but not rotation, called a _point constraint_.

The above examples use _single-ended_ constraints,
which limit the motion of one rigid body.
Constraints can also be _double-ended_,
in which case they link the motions of 2 rigid bodies.

For instance, an arm bone attached to a shoulder socket
could be simulated with a double-ended point constraint.
The constraint would prevent separation of the arm from the shoulder
without limiting the absolute motion of the arm-shoulder combination.


== Practical considerations

Confusingly, {Project} uses the `TwoBodyConstraint` class
to represent both single-ended and double-ended constraints.

Creating a constraint in {Project} begins with a reusable settings object.
You configure settings to specify constraint details
such as its initial location and orientation.
Then you invoke the `create()` method of the settings object,
specifying 2 bodies the new constraint will apply to.

* For a double-ended constraint,
  both bodies should be movable and added to the same physics system:

[source,java]
----
TwoBodyConstraintSettings settings = /* ... */;
TwoBodyConstraint constraint = settings.create(body1, body2);
----
* For a single-ended constraint,
  one of the bodies should be a dummy returned by `Body.sFixedToWorld()`.
  The other body should be dynamic and added to a physics system:

[source,java]
----
TwoBodyConstraintSettings settings = /* ... */;
Body dummyBody = Body.sFixedToWorld();
TwoBodyConstraint constraint = settings.create(realBody, dummyBody);
----

For a constraint to be effective, it must be added to the same physics system
as its movable bodies:

[source,java]
----
Constraint constraint = settings.create(body1, body2);
physicsSystem.addConstraint(constraint);
----


== SixDofConstraint basics

`SixDofConstraint` is a very flexible constraint
that illustrates features common to many other types of constraints.

As the name implies,
a `SixDofConstraint` can constrain up to 6 degrees of freedom.

The _value_ of a translation DOF is a linear offset (in meters).
The value of a rotation DOF is an angle (in radians).

By default, all 6 DOFs of a `SixDofConstraint` are _free_ to assume any value,
but you can _fix_ a DOF to a specific value
by invoking `settings.makeFixedAxis()`.

In this manner, a 6-DOF constraint can simulate other types of constraints:

* For a hinge constraint, fix 2 rotation DOFs and all 3 translation DOFs.
* For a slider constraint, fix 2 translation DOFs and all 3 rotation DOFs.
* For a point constraint, fix all 3 rotation DOFs.

=== HelloConstraint

{url-tutorial}/HelloConstraint.java[HelloConstraint] is a {Sport} app
that simulates a single-ended hinge constraint.

Things to notice while running the app:

. The gray ball is kinematic, moved by the mouse.
. A magenta rotor rotates around its Y axis, indicated by the green arrow.
. By striking the rotor with the ball, you can influence its motion.
. Because the ball's motion is irresistible,
  you can briefly shift the rotor's Y axis,
  but the constraint soon forces it back into place.

=== HelloPivot

Many constraints involve a fixed point, called a _pivot_.

{url-tutorial}/HelloPivot.java[HelloPivot]
is similar to HelloConstraint except:

* the rotor is smaller,
* the constraint's pivot is located outside the rotor,
* the arrow is red,
  and points from rotor's center to the pivot.

Things to notice while running the app:

* Moving a constraint's pivot changes its effect.

=== HelloDoubleEnded

{url-tutorial}/HelloDoubleEnded.java[HelloDoubleEnded] is a {Sport} app
that demonstrates a double-ended 6-DOF constraint
simulating a point constraint.

Things to notice while running the app:

. The gray paddle is kinematic, moved by the mouse.
. The magenta ball is dynamic.
. The constraint (indicated by red and green arrows)
  links the ball to paddle,
  such that motion of the paddle affects that of the ball,
  even when they aren't in contact.


== More features of constraints

We've seen how each DOF in a 6-DOF constraint can be fixed or free.
There's also a 3rd possibility;
a DOF can be _limited_ to values in a specific range.
By imposing _limits_, you can prevent a door from sliding or swinging too far.

In addition to limits, `SixDofConstraint`
also implements motors, servos, and springs:

* Using a _motor_, you can open or close a door or cause it
  to move smoothly to a specific position, as if under remote control.
* Using a _spring_, you can cause a door to automatically return
  to a neutral position when released.

You can also:

* disable a constraint temporarily,
* customize the number of iterations used to solve a constraint, and
* disable collisions between the end bodies.

=== Limits

{url-tutorial}/HelloLimit.java[HelloLimit] is a {Sport} app
that demonstrates a single-ended 6-DOF constraint
with 2 limited translation DOFs to limit the motion of a magenta ball.

. Use the mouse-controlled kinematic paddle to push the ball around.
. The ball is confined to a square region directly above the green box.

=== Motors

Motors are used to control motion within a constraint.
In `SixDofConstraint`, each DOF has its own motor, which is disabled by default.
Depending on how a motor is configured,
it can control either values or velocities.

{url-tutorial}/HelloMotor.java[HelloMotor] is a {Sport} app
that demonstrates a double-ended 6-DOF constraint
with its Y-rotation motor enabled.
The motor controls the angular velocity of the door relative to the frame.

. All DOFs except Y rotation are locked at zero.
. Y rotation is limited between 0 and 1.2 radians.
. The pivot is located just to the left of the door.
. Press kbd:[Space bar] to start the motor or reverse its direction.

In {url-tutorial}/HelloServo.java[HelloServo],
the motor controls the orientation of the door relative to the frame.

. Press kbd:[1], kbd:[2], kbd:[3], and kbd:[4]
  to drive the door to various orientations.

=== Springs

Springs can be used to soften the limits of a constraint.
In `SixDofConstraint`, each DOF has its own spring.
By default, springs are configured for maximal stiffness and damping,
resulting in a constraint with "hard" limits of motion.

There are 2 ways to configure a spring:

* In `FrequencyAndDamping` mode (the default)
  you specify the spring's resonant frequency (in Hertz)
  and damping ratio (1 = critical damping).
* In `StiffnessAndDamping` mode,
  you specify the spring's stiffness coefficient
  and damping coefficient.

To clarify the distinction between a damping ratio and damping coefficient,
refer to
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping[the Wikipedia article on damping].

{url-tutorial}/HelloSpring.java[HelloSpring] is a {Sport} app
that demonstrates a single-ended 6-DOF constraint
with all its translation DOFs fixed.
Springs on the X-translation and Z-translation DOFs allow the magenta ball
to oscillate around the origin while remaining in the X-Z plane.

. Use the mouse-controlled paddle to push the magenta ball around.
. The farther the ball gets from the origin,
  the stronger the spring's restorative force becomes.

=== Disable a constraint

Constraints are enabled by default.
You can disable a constraint  with `constraint.setEnabled(false)`.


=== Solver iterations

The Jolt-Physics constraint solver uses an iterative algorithm
to solve for positions and velocities.

For each constraint, you can override the number of iterations
the solver performs:

* `constraint.setNumPositionStepsOverride()`
  overrides the number of position iterations
* `constraint.setNumVelocityStepsOverride()`
   overrides the number of velocity iterations


=== Disable collisions

It's often desirable to disable collisions
between the bodies of a double-ended constraint.
This can be accomplished by applying a collision-group filter to the bodies:

[source,java]
----
int numSubGroups = 1;
GroupFilterTable filter = new GroupFilterTable(numSubGroups);
body1.setCollisionGroup(new CollisionGroup(filter, 0, 0));
body2.setCollisionGroup(new CollisionGroup(filter, 0, 0));
----


== Other constraint classes

`SixDofConstraint` is just one of the 12 concrete subclasses
of `TwoBodyConstraint`:

* `ConeConstraint` joins bodies at a specific point
   while limiting the angle between specific local axes
* `DistanceConstraint` holds (specific points on) bodies
   at a fixed distance from one another
* `FixedConstraint` fixes all 6 DOFs,
   holding bodies in a specific position relative to each other
* `GearConstraint` constrains bodies to have proportional rates of rotation
   around specific axes
* `HingeConstraint` joins bodies at a specific point
   while allowing rotation around a specific axis
* `PathConstraint` constrains bodies to a specific path
* `PointConstraint` fixes all translation DOFs,
  joining bodies at a specific point while allowing rotation around any axis
* `PulleyConstraint`
* `RackAndPinionConstraint` constrains rotation of body1 to translation of body2
* `SliderConstraint`
  allows translation along a single axis while preventing rotation
* `SwingTwistConstraint` allows rotation within specific limits
