The `HelloJoltJni` app
(introduced on xref:add.adoc[the previous page])
is simple, readable, and complete.
However, as a console app, its output is limited to text.

Text provides scant insight into what the physics simulation is doing.
For most people, pictures are much easier to understand.

For the purpose of this tutorial series,
I've created a graphics engine named {Sport}
(the Simple Physics-ORienTed engine for Jolt).
{Sport} enables us to visualize physics objects
without adding much code to the tutorial apps.
It is open-source, written in Java, and available from
https://github.com/stephengold/sport-jolt[GitHub] and
https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.github.stephengold/sport-jolt[Maven Central].


== HelloSport

{url-tutorial}/HelloSport.java[HelloSport]
is a direct conversion of `HelloJoltJni` into a {Sport} app.

Details to note:

. The app is declared as a subclass of `BasePhysicsApp`.
. The app implements both abstract methods of `BasePhysicsApp`
  (`createSystem` and `populateSystem`),
  which are invoked automatically.
. `BasePhysicsApp` automatically loads the {ProjectAdj} native library.
. `BasePhysicsApp` provides:
..  the `physicsSystem` field to access the system and
..  the `visualizeShape()` method to visualize the shape of a physics object.
. Whereas `HelloJoltJni` simulated one step at a time,
  `HelloSport` attempts real-time simulation.

Running `HelloSport` should open a window on your computer's desktop
and play a brief animation of a sphere falling onto a horizontal surface.

Pressing kbd:[Esc] should close the window and terminate the app.

Hereafter, all the tutorial apps will use {Sport}.
Features of {Sport} will be introduced as needed.


== Summary

* {Sport} is a graphics engine, created specifically for {ProjectAdj} tutorials.
* {Sport} provides a simple toolkit for visualizing 3-D physics.
