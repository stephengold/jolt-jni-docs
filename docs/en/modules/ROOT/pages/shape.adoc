A _collision shape_
describes the shape and size of a collision object such as a rigid body.

== The 18 shape classes

The examples so far have all used spheres, cubes, and/or cylinders.
However, those are but 3 of the 18 concrete subclasses of
`Shape`.

The subclasses are summarized here, in lexicographic order,
with illustrations and lists of key properties (explained below):

== Creating shapes

While simple shapes like boxes and spheres can be instantiated directly,
complex ones can only be created using a settings object.
For instance, to instantiate a `ConvexHullShape`,
you must use a `ConvexHullShapeSettings` object:

[source,java]
----
ConvexHullShapeSettings settings = new ConvexHullShapeSettings(points);
ShapeResult result = settings.create();
assert result.isValid();
ShapeRefC ref = result.get();
ConvexHullShape shape = (ConvexHullShape) ref.getPtr();
----

== Decorated and compound

A _decorated shape_ is derived from a pre-existing _inner shape_.
For instance, you can create spheres with off-center mass
by applying `OffsetCenterOfMassShape` to ordinary spheres.

A _compound shape_ combines any number of _child shapes_
into a single shape:

* A `MutableCompoundShape` allows child shapes to be added or removed
from after the compound is created.
* A `StaticCompoundShape` prohibits such modifications.

== Convex versus non-convex

The _convex_ collision-shape classes are those
that guarantee the _convex property_:
for any 2 locations inside a shape,
the line segment connecting those locations lies entirely inside the shape.

To test whether a shape belongs to a convex class:

[source,java]
----
boolean convexClass = (shape instanceof ConvexShape);
// or
boolean convexClass = (shape.getType() == EShapeType.Convex);
----

NOTE: In {Project}, "convex" is a property of classes, not objects.
While specific *instances* of non-convex classes possess the convex property,
those classes don't guarantee it for *all* instances.

== Convex radius

_Convex radius_ is a property found only in convex shapes
with sharp edges and/or corners.

To speed up collision detection,
Jolt Physics rounds off edges and corners.
The geometrical shape is first shrunk by the convex radius,
then inflated again by the same amount.

For boxes, cylinders, tapered cylinders, and triangles,
convex radius limits the minimum size of shapes.
For such shapes, the radius defaults to 5 centimeters.
To create very small shapes of this sort,
it may be necessary override the default value.

For convex hulls, the default convex radius
depends on the vertices used to construct the shape.

== Choosing a shape

For efficient simulation, the general rule is:
"Use the simplest shape that yields the desired *behavior*."
Focusing on behavior (rather than appearance)
helps you avoid simulating details that don't matter.
For instance:

* A character's hair should probably be omitted from their collision shape.
* Any small object that only encounters large, flat surfaces
  can probably be approximated by a convex hull.
* As long as a container remains sealed,
  its collision shape need not be hollow.

== Summary

* {Project} provides 18 types of collision shapes,
  ranging from the trivial `EmptyShape`
  to the costly `MeshShape`.
* Collision-shape instances classified as "non-convex"
  may still exhibit the convex property.
* Most convex shapes incorporate a convex radius to round off the corners.
* Use the simplest shape that yields the desired behavior.
