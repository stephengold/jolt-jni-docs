A _collision shape_
describes the shape and size of a physics object such as a rigid body.


== The 18 shape classes

The examples so far have all used spheres, cubes, and/or cylinders.
However, those are but 3 of the 18 concrete subclasses of
{url-jj}/Shape.html[`Shape`].

The subclasses are summarized here, in lexicographic order,
with illustrations and lists of key properties (explained below):

== Creating shapes

While simple shapes like boxes and spheres can be instantiated directly,
some shapes can only be created using a settings object.
For instance, to instantiate a `ConvexHullShape`,
you must use a `ConvexHullShapeSettings` object:

[source,java]
----
ConvexHullShapeSettings settings = new ConvexHullShapeSettings(points);
ShapeResult result = settings.create();
assert result.isValid();
ShapeRefC ref = result.get();
ConvexHullShape shape = (ConvexHullShape) ref.getPtr();
----


== Decorated and compound

A _decorated shape_ is derived from a pre-existing _inner shape_.
For instance, you can create spheres with off-center mass
by applying `OffsetCenterOfMassShape` to ordinary spheres.

A _compound shape_ combines any number of pre-existing _child shapes_
into a single shape:

* A `MutableCompoundShape` allows child shapes to be added or removed
from after the compound is created.
* A `StaticCompoundShape` prohibits such modifications.


== Convex versus non-convex

The _convex_ collision-shape classes are those
that guarantee the _convex property_:
for any 2 locations inside a shape,
the line segment connecting those locations lies entirely inside the shape.

To test whether a shape belongs to a convex class:

[source,java]
----
boolean isConvexClass = (shape instanceof ConvexShape);
// or
boolean isConvexClass = (shape.getType() == EShapeType.Convex);
----

NOTE: In {Project}, "convex" is a property of classes, not objects.
While specific *instances* of non-convex classes possess the convex property,
those classes don't guarantee it for *all* instances.


== Convex radius

_Convex radius_ is a property found only in convex shapes
with sharp edges and/or corners.

To speed up collision detection,
Jolt Physics rounds off edges and corners.
The geometrical shape is first shrunk by the convex radius,
then inflated again by the same amount.

For boxes, cylinders, tapered cylinders, and triangles,
convex radius limits the minimum size of shapes.
For such shapes, the radius defaults to 5 centimeters.
To create very small shapes of this sort,
it may be necessary override the default value.

For convex hulls, the default convex radius
depends on the vertices used to construct the shape.


== Choosing a shape

For efficient simulation, the general rule is:
"Use the simplest shape that yields the desired *behavior*."
Focusing on behavior (rather than appearance)
helps you avoid simulating details that don't matter.
For instance:

* A character's hair should probably be omitted from their collision shape.
* Any small object that only encounters large, flat surfaces
  can probably be approximated by a convex hull.
* As long as a container remains sealed,
  its collision shape need not be hollow.

Mesh shapes, which support the greatest detail,
cannot be used in movable bodies.
If you need to simulate a moving mesh,
first try approximating the mesh with a convex shape.
For meshes that cannot be approximated this way
(due to bends, holes, indentations, or steep protrusions)
the fallback is to decompose the mesh
into a small number of convex shapes that,
when compounded together, approximate the desired behavior.

Depending how much you know about a mesh,
there are various approaches to decomposing it:

* If the mesh was generated procedurally, it may be convenient
  to decompose it during the generation process.
* If the mesh was crafted in a tool such as https://www.blender.org/[Blender],
  it may be practical to manually decompose it there,
  into sub-meshes that are convex or nearly so.
* As a last resort, you can decompose any mesh into triangle shapes,
  though the resulting compound shape may be expensive to simulate.


=== Automated decomposition

For situations where other decomposition approaches are impractical,
{Project} incorporates Khaled Mamou's
https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd[Volumetric-Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition (V-HACD) algorithm].
V-HACD makes it easy to decompose a 3-D mesh of triangles into a
compound of convex-hull shapes:

[source,java]
----
import com.github.stephengold.joltjni.vhacd.ConvexHull;
import com.github.stephengold.joltjni.vhacd.Decomposer;
import com.github.stephengold.joltjni.vhacd.Parameters;

// ...

float[] locationArray = /* vertex locations in the mesh ... */
int[] indexArray = /* vertex indices in the mesh ... */
Decomposer decomposer = new Decomposer();
Parameters tuningParameters = new Parameters();
Collection<ConvexHull> hulls
        = decomposer.decompose(locationArray, indexArray, tuningParameters);
StaticCompoundShapeSettings compoundSettings
        = new StaticCompoundShapeSettings();
compoundSettings.addHulls(hulls);
----

The V-HACD algorithm is costly to run, but for many applications it can
be run in advance and the output stored until needed.
During simulation, the resulting shape will usually be much more efficient
than a compound-of-triangles shape.

== Summary

* {Project} provides 18 types of collision shapes,
  ranging from the trivial `EmptyShape`
  to the detail-oriented `MeshShape`.
* Collision-shape instances classified as "non-convex"
  may still exhibit the convex property.
* Most convex shapes incorporate a convex radius to round off the corners.
* Use the simplest shape that yields the desired behavior.
* For moving bodies,
  mesh shapes can be approximated by compounds of convex shapes,
  such as convex hulls.
